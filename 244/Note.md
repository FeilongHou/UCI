# COMPSCI 244
**IoT:** internet of things, set of connected devices \
collect data, send to data center for computing because embedded system has limtied processing power \
Demand of real time computer made cloud computing obsolete \
embedded system today requires computational power \
cyber-physical system can react or actuate base on data collected. 

**Efficiency**:
- code size
- run time
- weight 
- cost
- energy
  
real time constraints: A real time system must react to stimuli within the time interval dictated by the environment, CPS must meet real-time constraints. 

a sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity \
an actuator is a device that modifies a physical quantity 

design issue with sensors
1. calibration
2. nonlinearity
3. sampling
4. noise
5. failures

model is equations, target is the real thing, high fidelity is how werll the model matches the target. 

A model is deterministic if given initial state and the inputs, the model defines exactly one behavior. \
large system and be non-deterministic \
